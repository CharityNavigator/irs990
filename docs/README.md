# IRS Form 990 Decoder

This repository contains everything you need to get started exploring the IRS Form 990 dataset [hosted by Amazon Web Services on S3](https://aws.amazon.com/public-datasets/irs-990/). This includes instructions for an easier-to-use 990 database provided free to the public by [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/).

## New version available!

As part of the [Nonprofit Open Data Collective](https://github.com/Nonprofit-Open-Data-Collective), Charity Navigator has been proud to contribute to the [eFile Master Concordance](https://github.com/Nonprofit-Open-Data-Collective/irs-efile-master-concordance-file), which provides a standardized mapping between the many XML schemas in the primary dataset. **The concordance is still in draft.** A [validation event](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYwFO7k_HzkkHYdD9s8xFXBfuL4OrWZNmxeC6cLEA26Dk_IA/viewform) is taking place in November 2017.

As a result of this hard work, Charity Navigator now has code capable of extracting **all fields** from the **entire** IRS eFile dataset. The data will be made publcily available after the Validatathon event. If you wish to preview the data, please follow the instructions in the readme for the [new code](https://github.com/CharityNavigator/990_long).

## Working with the original 990 Toolkit

Due to the imminent release of a much richer dataset, we have deprecated our original toolkit. If you wish to access it anyway, you can view the original documentation [here](https://charitynavigator.github.io/irs990/original).
